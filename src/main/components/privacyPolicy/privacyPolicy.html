            <h3>SECTION 4 - SHOPIFY</h3>
            <p>Our store is hosted on Shopify Inc. They provide us with the online e-commerce platform that allows us to sell

            <p>Payment:</p>
            <p>If you choose a direct payment gateway to complete your purchase, then Shopify stores your credit card data.
                It is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction
                data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete,
                your purchase transaction information is deleted. All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set
                by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa,
                MasterCard, American Express and Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit
                card information by our store and its service providers. For more insight, you may also want to read Shopify’s

            <h3>SECTION 5 - THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</h3>
            <p>In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the

            <p>However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors,
                have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your
                purchase-related transactions.</p>
            <p>For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which
                your personal information will be handled by these providers. In particular, remember that certain providers
                may be located in or have facilities that are located a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So
                if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider,
                then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider
                or its facilities are located.</p>
            <p>As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in
                the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure
                under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.</p>

                sure it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed.</p>
